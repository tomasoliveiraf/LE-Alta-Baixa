##### 5 Conclusion and Discussion
Since its emergence, type design has been adapting to technological advances. Nowadays, most typefaces are developed by type designers, who study the design and anatomy of each character with great precision. Type design is a difficult and time-consuming process. Our approach takes advantage of the knowledge present in the design of a typeface and the computational possibilities that ANNs provide. We propose a VAE combined with an Autoregressive model to generate glyphs’ skeletons by interpolating existing ones. Our contributions are the following, a sketch decoder capable of (i) reconstructing images of glyphs’ skeletons using a single stroke, (ii) controlling font styles by navigating the latent space, (iii) interpolating between two skeletons to create new ones. By creating interpolations between existing fonts we develop a method to help designers in making their artificial variable fonts, easing the usual glyph production. We also explored a feature of a skeleton extraction library, which calculates the stroke width at each point of the letter skeleton, to produce a fill for the generated skeletons. By interpolating between skeletons of different letters we are creating new glyph forms that resemble other existing glyphs. This opens up new exploration possibilities for the future. We envision that our approach can find use as a tool for graphic designers to facilitate font design. We can employ this system to generate new skeletons, which the designer can fill with the desired style, but also be used as inspiration seed to create new glyphs.
We expect to make several future contributions. First, we want to change the architecture of the sketch decoder to be able to use multiple strokes. In some cases, our approach was able to draw skeleton letters that require more than one line by overlapping them. However, if the sketch decoder had access to multiple strokes, this problem could be solved more easily. Finally, we intend to change the input of the network so it can receive a vector version of the skeletons instead of a pixel-based image. This way we can work with an end-to-end architecture focused on vector format leading to better quality skeletons without any loss of information.

The results show that the model is not only able to decode meaningful skeletons but it is also able to control several characteristics of it. In the example of the letter “N”, not only the model can control the width of the letter, but it also controls its height.

As it is possible to observe in the interpolations presented in Figure 6, not only the model is able to decode meaningful skeletons but it is able to control several characteristics of it. In the example of the letter “H”, the width of the letter is slightly changed until it matches the width of each skeleton input image. In the case of the letter “N”, not only the model is able to control the width of the letter, but it also controls its height. At the same time the width of the letter changes, its height is also modified to match its parents, which allows wider control over the skeleton that can be created. In the case of the letter “T”, it is possible to observe that the model can also control how much the letter is italic. As we go from the left input skeleton image to the right, the stem of the letter gets closer to a vertical position. This not only shows that the model is capable of perceiving different angles but it can also transition between them gradually. Therefore, we might be able to control all these stylisations of the skeletons by navigating the latent space. This can be observed in the visualisation shown in Figure 5. There are certain regions dedicated to different letter styles. So, we can navigate this space in order to create fonts that demonstrate a set of desired styles.

We also interpolate between skeletons of different letters. By observing the resulting skeletons present in Figure 7, we observe that the model is able to pass from one skeleton to another from different letters. Sometimes the morphings are not even expected to be smooth, because some letters have anatomical parts completely different, like for instance the “Z” and “T”. The generated skeleton starts as “Z” but over time it loses its bottom crossstroke. Moreover, its diagonal stroke slightly changes its angle and transforms itself into the stem of a “T”. There are also other transformations that are expected, such as the case of “P” and “F”, which share a stem. Over the line, the generated skeleton opens its bowl to create the arms of the “F” and at the same time slightly inclines the stem to create an italic glyph according to the inclination of the “F”. Another information that we can obtain is that sometimes we start to visualise intermediate skeletons that look like other existing letter’s skeletons. For example, when we explore the latent space between “G” and “L” in some intermediary steps we can observe some resemblance with the letter “C”.

##### 4.4 Transforming skeletons into glyphs
So far, we have demonstrated how our system is able to reconstruct and create new skeletons through the exploration of latent space. However, our goal is to develop a tool to support the design process by allowing the creation of artificial variable fonts or morphing fonts, so it is imperative to test the application of the generated skeletons.

As mentioned before, the skeleton extraction library [16] allows, in addition to extracting the points, obtaining the stroke width at each point of the skeleton. When we created the dataset, by extracting the skeletons of the uppercase letters of the Latin alphabet for each font file that we selected, we saved the points of each skeleton and its stroke width to use posteriorly. With these values, we were able to interpolate the stroke width along with the generated skeleton. The process of filling the generated skeletons is the following. First, we randomly choose two skeletons to interpolate. Then, we calculate the stroke width at each point of the generated skeletons. To do this, we calculate the corresponding point on the skeletons that serve as input for the creation of intermediate skeletons. We do this calculation by overlapping the input skeletons and the generated skeleton and calculating the closest match. The stroke width at each point is a result of combining the interpolation of the widths of the input skeletons. Figure 8 shows some results in which each row represents a different interpolation. Looking at the generated glyphs, we can see that they look similar to a regular font. With a few adjustments, we could use them as a variable font. Now, with interpolated fill, the contrast between variations is more visible, because we had another parameter to the glyph design. By splitting the skeleton and the filler we have more visual possibilities because we are not stuck with a filler. In these tests, we use filling in the original fonts to fill in the intermediate ones, but it is not mandatory. We can even use some fonts to create the skeleton and others to create the filling or even use a fixed value along the skeleton. By applying the filling, the interpolated glyphs become more unique, by suffering more alterations when moving between the two input glyphs. For example, in the “S” (Figure 8) we can observe that besides the axis alteration, the glyphs also change in contrast. The generated “S” near the left is styled more like a modern font, with high contrast and serifs. From left to right the contrast inside the generated glyphs turns almost nil and they lost the serifs.

_IMG Fig 8.png

As mentioned before, our system provides a tool to facilitate the process of building these dynamic identities with a typographic component. With this tool, designers can generate skeletons and develop a filling to create their versions of glyphs. To demonstrate the application of our system we made a series of experimentations with different ways of using the obtained skeletons by our model (see Figure 9 and 10). In the first application (Figure 9), we present the interpolation* between two input glyphs. The input glyphs are represented in red and light blue while the generated one is in dark blue. To visualise the three superimposed glyphs, we apply the multiply effect, thus obtaining another colour that represents the common parts between the generated and the original ones. The generated glyphs are very diverse on a visual level, enabling the design of a dynamic visual identity with the use of only two fonts. We believe that the mutating factor of these results provides an identity that is easily placed side by side with the dynamic visual identities and variable fonts that are made these days. In the second application (Figure 10), the generated glyphs use just the interpolated skeletons. The stroke width is also calculated based on the input glyphs. However, the filling is further away from the traditional typographic visual aspect. Along the skeleton line, we draw a series of crosswise line segments to define the width of the glyph’ stroke. The density changes to accommodate the same number of line segments between each pair of points.

##### 4.1 Reconstruction of skeletons
As mentioned before, the model returns a sequence of points that, when connected, create a reconstruction of the skeleton image used as input. In most cases, the generated strokes reconstruct the basic features of the skeleton. For example, in the case of the letter “A”, the network first creates one stem, then the crossbar connects both stems and finally draws the second stem. Even though there is nothing to control the distance between points or to enforce them to be close, the network learns that it needs to connect both stems at the beginning and the end of the sequence. Another interesting feature observable in the reconstruction is related to how the ANN handles the letter “T”. This letter presents one of the simplest skeletons of the alphabet, so the network can learn how to generate the whole structure of the letter very quickly in comparison with others.

Figure 3 presents a comparison between the original inputs and the reconstructed skeletons using a single stroke. The reconstructions of “C”, “L” or “K”, for example, are very similar. The letters “A”, “X” and “K” present a more complex challenge to the network as it needs to create a path that overlaps itself to draw the whole letter structure with only one line. Sometimes, the serif is lost in the reconstruction due to the same issue. The line must overlap itself multiple times to create the small parts without messing with the overall structure of the letter. But the other reason for this could be that the number of letters with serif is lower than the number of letters without it. In summary, even though the small details of the letters might be lost, our network is able to create the minimal structure of the letter, generating skeletons that cannot be confused with any other letter.

###### 4.2 Latent representation of font style
To understand if the trained model can learn a latent representation for the different letters that is smooth and interpretable, we need to visualise the 64-dimensional z vectors for the dataset. So we take all the images of the dataset (68198 images) and encode them using our network. Then, using the means and standard deviations of each encoded image we took a sample from the distribution. Finally, we took all the z vectors and reduced their dimensionality using the t-SNE algorithm [27]. This allows us to reduce the z vectors from a size of 64 to two dimensions which can be translated to positions in a two- dimensional domain. For each position of a two-dimensional grid, we place the image of the best candidate. We select this candidate by finding the two-dimensional encoding closest to that position. Figure 4 presents the visualisation of the results. In general, the model can separate the different letters into clusters. In some cases, it is also possible to observe that similar letters are placed near each other, for example in the case of the letters “B”, “R” and “P”. These three letters present similar anatomical characteristics, they share a top bowl and they all have a vertical stem, thus they are placed near each other. The same happens for the letters “T” and “I” which are placed more separately from the rest but near each other. Even though the majority of the skeletons for the letter “I” is represented with a single stem, in some cases, when they have serif, they are similar to the letter “T” but with a cross stroke on the top and bottom part of the letter. This leads to both letters having a strong similarity between each other, therefore they are placed together in the latent space.

We also create a similar representation contemplating the skeleton images of a single letter (2623 images). To understand if the trained model was able to smoothly change styles within the same letter we created a similar visualisation as in Figure 4. Figure 5 presents the visualisation of the results for the letter “R”. As it is possible to observe, the model is able to separate the different font weights across the latent space, creating different regions. The zoom-in boxes show four separate locations where we notice a concentration of specific font styles. In (A) it is presented a region where the condensed fonts are, while the opposite corner (D) represents the most extended fonts. It is also possible to observe that (B) represents the italic, and finally (C) presents most of the fonts with serifs. Local changes within these regions are also visible, where the font width increases when distancing from the region (A) and approximating to the region (D). It is also possible to observe a slight increase in the font height in the top-bottom direction.

###### 4.3 Exploring the Latent Space
After analysing whether the latent space translates font characteristics for meaningful latent representation, we explore linear interpolations between pairs of skeletons for a given glyph. First, we encode two randomly selected fonts from the dataset into their corresponding z vectors. Then, we perform a linear interpolation between the two vectors and, using the trained sketch decoder, we reconstruct the skeletons for these vectors. Figure 6 shows some results of this exploration. The first and last glyph of each row are the original skeletons, and in the middle are the interpolations between them two. The interpolation percentage starts at 0% and ends at 100%, which means that the second skeleton is a reconstruction of the glyph on the left side, and the penultimate skeleton is a reconstruction of the glyph on the right.

##### 2 Related Work
Over time, the methods and technologies available for type design have improved and designers have to evolve and adapt their process of thinking in accordance. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revealed impressive advances, presenting high-resolution images nearly indistinguishable from the real ones. In the typographic field, they are helpful when one wishes to obtain coherent glyphs in a typeface. When designing a typeface, one has to simultaneously seek an aesthetically appealing result and coherence among the different glyphs. This can be facilitated by exploring the similarities between the same letter present across diverse fonts, and the transferred stylistic elements within the same font [5]. Balashova et al. [2] develop a stroke-based geometric model for glyphs, a fitting procedure to re-parametrise arbitrary fonts to capture these correlations. The framework uses a manifold learning technique that allows for interactively improving the fit quality and interpolating, adding or removing stylistic elements in existing fonts. Campbell and Kautz [3] develop a similar contour-based framework allowing the editing of a glyph and the propagation of stylistic elements across the entire alphabet. Phan et al. [19] and Suveeranont and Igarashi [26] present two different frameworks that give one or more outline-based glyphs of several characters as input, producing a complete typeface that bears a similar style to the inputs. Rehling and Hofstadter [21] use one or more grid-based lowercase letters to generate the rest of the Roman alphabet, creating glyphs that share different style features. Azadi et al. [1] develop an end-to-end stacked conditional GAN model to generate a set of highly-stylised glyph images following a consistent style from very few examples.

We can also imitate the behaviour of a variable font using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and interpolate to obtain intermediate results. Lopes et al. [14] model the drawing process of fonts by building sequential generative models of vector graphics. Their model provides a scale-invariant representation of imagery. The latent representation may be systematically exploited to achieve style propagation. Shamir and Rappoport [24] present a parametric feature-based font design approach. The development of a visual design system and the use of constraints for preserving the designer’s intentions create a more natural environment in which high-level parametric behaviours can be defined. By changing the glyph parameters they create several family instances. Also, outside the typographic field, there are some good examples exploring the latent space. Sketch-RNN [7] is an RNN able to construct stroke- based drawings. The network produces sketches of common objects in a vector format and explores the latent space interpolation of various vector images. There is also increased attention to these networks and their application to facilitate the use and combination of fonts. A usual way to combine different fonts is by using fonts from the same family or created by the same designer. Another way is to find fonts that match x-height and ascenders/descenders. Fontjoy [20] is another tool to facilitate the process of mixing and matching typefaces and choosing fonts to use side by side. FontMap [8] and Font-VAE [10] are tools developed with the goal of discovering alternative fonts with the same aesthetics.

#### 3 Approach
In this section, we present the developed model that generates new letter skeletons by interpolating existing ones. This process allows us to control the style of the resulting font by navigating the latent space. We explain all the steps taken, from the data collection and editing, passing through the development of the network architecture until the experimentation and analysis of the results.

###### 3.1 Data
One of the most important aspects of our approach is the collection and pre-processing of the dataset. We compile a collection of fonts in TTF font format with different weights from Google Fonts [6]. This dataset is composed of five different font styles, Serif, Sans Serif, Display, Handwriting and Monospace. We opted not to use handwriting and display fonts because they were largely distinct from the rest, which is not desirable for our approach. Their ornamental component, sometimes not even filled, complicates the extraction of a representative skeleton. We only worked with 26 characters (A-Z) of the Latin alphabet in their capital format. We believed that, as a work in progress, it would be best to create a dataset with a few characters. By just using capital letters, we are reducing the complexity of the approach. After selecting the fonts, we remained with 2623 TTF files. Then, we use the library Skelefont [16] to extract the skeleton of a font file. It applies the Zhang-Suen Thinning Algorithm [29] to derive the structural lines of a binary image. This library also allows the extraction of the points of the skeletons as well as the connections between them. It can also calculate the distance between the points and their closest borderline pixel, returning the stroke width of the original glyph at each of these points.
For each font, we rasterise the vectors that compose the skeleton of each glyph into a 64x64px black and white image. We also save all points’ positions and stroke width of the original glyph in a file to use later to generate the filling of the glyphs. Then, we repeat the process for the 26 letters of the alphabet (capital letters of the Latin alphabet only). This process is shown in the first three images of the diagram in Figure 2.

###### 3.2 Network Architecture
The proposed model consists of a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) [11] and an Autoregressive sketch decoder. We used a VAE instead of a regular AE to allow us to manipulate the latent vectors more easily. The output of the VAE are the parameters of distribution instead of vectors in the latent space. Moreover, the VAE imposes a constraint on this latent distribution forcing it to be a normal distribution which makes sure that the latent space is regularised. Therefore, we can create smoother transitions between different fonts when we sample the latent space moving from one cluster to the other. The Conditional part of the model allows us to input which letter we are encoding and
decoding allowing us to manipulate better which letter we are creating. Finally, as all the letters share the same latent space we can also explore the skeletons between different letters.

Figure 2 shows a diagram of the architecture used. In summary, the encoder employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that processes the greyscale images and encodes them into two 64-D latent vectors which consist of a set of means (μ) and standard deviations (σ) of a Gaussian representation. Through experimentation, we found that size 64 for the latent code presents the best results for our approach as it is a good trade-off, allowing us to compress all the characteristics of the letter while keeping its tractability. Then, using the mean and standard deviation we take a sample from the Gaussian representation z to be used as input for both decoders, the image decoder and the sketch decoder. The image decoder consists of a set of convolutional transpose layers that receive the z vector and decodes it into a greyscale image which is compared with the original input. The sketch decoder consists of an LSTM [9] with dropout [25, 23] that transforms the z vector into a sequence of 30 points creating a single continuous path. This path is rasterised using a differentiable vector graphics library [13] to produce an output image. This library allows converting vector data to a raster representation while facilitating backpropagation between the two domains. In the rasterisation process, we take the sequence of 30 x and y values and transform them to canvas coordinates. Then, we create a line that connects all points following the same order they are returned from the sketch decoder. The width of this path needs to be carefully selected to match the width of the original skeleton. If the width of the path is thinner than in the original images, at some part of the training process, the network stops trying to compose the whole letter and starts to fill the width of the letter in a zig-zag manner. However, if the line is thicker than in the original images we lose detail in the final skeleton.

Finally, we render the produced path in a canvas as a greyscale image that is compared with the original image. Although the standard VAE works at the pixel level, the output of our sketch decoder is a sequence of points, thus allow- ing the generation of scalable vector graphics that allow easier manipulation of the generated skeletons without losing quality. The loss value is calculated in a similar way as in the standard VAEs. We calculate the Binary Cross Entropy between the output images of the image decoder and the original inputs. We also calculate the Kullback-Leibler Divergence [12] to allow a regularised distribution of the latent space. Finally, we compute the Binary Cross Entropy between the original inputs and the output of the sketch decoder. To obtain the final loss value we add the three values together.

#### 4 Results
The VAE and sketch decoder trained for 50 epochs with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 256. As mentioned before, we use 2623 64 × 64px black and white images of skeletons for each capital letter of the Latin alphabet, so our dataset is constituted of 68 198 images.

### Using Autoencoders to Generate Skeleton-based Typography

##### Abstract.
Type Design is a domain that multiple times has profited from the emergence of new tools and technologies. The transformation of type from physical to digital, the dissemination of font design software and the adoption of web typography make type design better known and more accessible. This domain has received an even greater push with the increasing adoption of generative tools to create more diverse and experimental fonts. Nowadays, with the application of Machine Learning to various domains, typography has also been influenced by it. In this work, we produce a dataset by extracting letter skeletons from a collection of existing fonts. Then we trained a Variational Autoencoder and a Sketch Decoder to learn to create these skeletons that can be used to generate new ones by exploring the latent space. This process also allows us to control the style of the resulting skeletons and interpolate between different characters. Finally, we developed new glyphs by filling the generated skeletons based on the original letters’ stroke width and showing some applications of the results.

##### 1 Introduction
The design of type has undergone numerous changes over time [4]. In the early years, typography was seen as a system made up of a series of rules. The artistic movements that arrived at the beginning of the twentieth century rejected the historical forms and transformed outdated aspects of visual language and expression. However, projects that combined software, arts and design only appeared a few years later with the proliferation of personal computers, allowing programming to reach a wider audience. Thanks to all these changes, the tools to design type changed, and new possibilities for typographic experimentation appeared, resulting in (i) grammar-based techniques that explore the principle of database amplification (e.g. [2]); (ii) evolutionary systems that breed design solutions under the direction of a designer (e.g. [22, 15]); (iii) or even, Machine Learning (ML) systems that learn the glyphs features to build new ones (e.g. [14]) [18]. These computational approaches can also be helpful as a starting point of inspiration.

Most emerging fonts continue to be developed by type designers who study the shape of each letter and its design with great precision, despite the emergence of these new possibilities. Type design is a hugely complex discipline, and its expertise ensures typography quality [28]. Moreover, with the proliferation of web typography and online reading, the use of variable and dynamic fonts has increased, allowing more options for font designers and font users. Additionally, visual identities created nowadays are becoming more dynamic [17]. Museums, institutions, organisations, events and media increasingly rely on this type of identity. Consequently, designers should adapt their work to these new possibilities by creating dynamic identities with animations and mutations. Even though new computer systems create expressive and out-of-the-box results, they do not have the knowledge of an expert. But this is also an advantage, allowing non-arbitrary exploitation that extends the range of possibilities. It is necessary to create a balance to take advantage of the computational systems and the expert labour. Moreover, most generative systems that design type focus on the letters’ filling and don’t see the structure of a glyph as a variation parameter.

To overcome these limitations, we propose an Autoregressive model [9] that creates new glyph skeletons by the interpolation of existing ones. Our skeleton-based approach uses glyphs skeletons of existing fonts as input to ensure the quality of the generated results. The division of the structure and the filling of the glyphs add variability to the results. Different glyphs can be created by just changing the structure or the filling. The proposed approach enables the exploration of a continuous range of font styles by navigating on the Autoencoder (AE) learnt latent space. With the results of this approach, it is also possible to apply different filling methods that use the stroke width of the original letters to produce new glyphs (see Figure 1).

The remainder of this paper is divided into three sections. The following section, Related Work, analyzes related projects in the domain of computational typography with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The second section, Approach, describes the construction of the used dataset and explains the training process. Then, in the Results section, we present and discuss the different exper- imentations performed and the obtained results. In this section, we also present a set of different possible applications of the outputs of our system. In the final section, Conclusion and Discussion, we draw some conclusions and lay out future work.
